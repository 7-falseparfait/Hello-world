Hello-World Project Overview

Introduction
Hello-World is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the StarkNet platform, utilizing the Cairo 1.0 programming language. This project showcases a robust and scalable architecture, integrating various tools and technologies to provide a seamless user experience.

Architecture
*Smart Contract Layer (StarkNet)*
- *Language:* Cairo 1.0
- *Platform:* StarkNet (ZK-Rollup Layer 2 on Ethereum)
- *Dev Tools:*
    - Protostar: Cairo development framework
    - StarkNet.js: For frontend interaction with contracts
    - Apibara: StarkNet event stream/indexing

*Frontend (Web App)*
- *Framework:* Next.js (React-based, SSR-ready)
- *Styling/UI:*
    - Tailwind CSS: Utility-first styling
    - ShadCN UI: Clean component library with Tailwind integration
    - Framer Motion: Animations and transitions
- *Wallet Integration:*
    - StarkNet Wallets (e.g., Argent X, Braavos)
    - StarkNet.js for connection + signing
- *Charting/Market Data:*
    - TradingView Charting Library
    - CoinGecko API or Chainlink for price feeds
    - The Graph (future-ready) for subgraph querying if available for StarkNet

*Backend / Infrastructure (Lightweight)*
- *Backend (Optional / Minimal):* Node.js or Express.js
- *Database (Off-chain Indexing):* PostgreSQL or Supabase
- *Indexing:*
    - Apibara: StarkNet event stream tool
    - Dojo (if using entity/component design in future)

*Storage*
- *Decentralized Storage:* IPFS / Filecoin or Bundlr / Arweave
- *On-chain Metadata Reference:* Smart contracts store IPFS hashes or Arweave links as content references

Tooling & Dev Experience
- *GitHub:* Repository hosting
- *Vercel:* Frontend deployment
- *Foundry:* Testing Cairo contracts
